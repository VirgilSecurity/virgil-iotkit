## Introduction
[Virgil Security](https://virgilsecurity.com) provides a set of APIs for adding security to any application or IoT device.

Virgil IoTKit is a C library for connecting IoT devices to the Virgil IoT Security Platform. IoTKit helps you easily add security to your IoT devices at any lifecycle stage for securely provisioning and authenticating devices, updating firmware and TrustLists, and exchanging messages using any transport protocols.

This is Virgil IoTKit C library wrapper for C++ based on Qt crossplatform framework.

## Features
Virgil IoTKit Qt framework provides you with the following possibilities:
- **Snap Protocol**. The basis of interaction between Virgil IoT devices is the SNAP protocol. IoTKit Qt framework provides you with the basic class for personal implementations creation and UDP Broadcast implementation.
- **INFO Client**. SNAP protocol gives you the basis for different services building. INFO Service allows for active devices broadcast their versions, statistical information etc. INFO Server is the end device, which transmits its state. INFO Client is a device that collects information over a network. IoTKit Qt framework provides you with the class for INFO Client service operation.
- **Sniffer**. IoTKit Qt framework provides you with a sniffer for all Virgil IoTKit packets scanning inside of the network.
- **Simple configuration and initialization of IoTKit Qt framework**. IoTKit Qt framework uses the "facade" pattern. VSQIoTKitFacade class is an object which consists of all framework entities. During the startup it gets full information about the library - which interfaces should be used, which solutions will be used, separate modules settings etc. There is also an unifying umbrella header VSQIoTKit.h with all framework modules except default implementations.
- **QML Support**. All IoTKit Qt framework classes are created to be used in QML project. You can build lists with a data model based on INFO Client and Sniffer. All future implementations will also support this technology.
- **Cross-platform**. Library is implemented on C++ classes based on Qt cross-platform library. Different desktop and mobile platforms like Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, iOS are supported.

## Installation
- Virgil IoTKit Qt framework is a part of Virgil IoTKit library. Therefore, this library has to be installed first.
- Next you need to install Qt Framework version 5.12.6 or higher.
- After that you should compile Virgil IoTKit for the necessary platform. To do this, use the script `scripts/build-for-qt.sh` and indicate the preferred platform. Example:
  - To get a library for Android: `ext/virgil-iotkit/scripts/build-for-qt.sh android armeabi-v7a`
  - To get a library for iOS library: `ext/virgil-iotkit/scripts/build-for-qt.sh ios`
  - To get a library for Linux library: `ext/virgil-iotkit/scripts/build-for-qt.sh linux`
  - To get a library for MacOS library: `ext/virgil-iotkit/scripts/build-for-qt.sh mac`
  - To get a library for Windows library: `ext/virgil-iotkit/scripts/build-for-qt.sh windows`

## Usage example

Virgil IoTKit Qt framework is tapped by integration/qt/iotkit.pri file.

Virgil IoTKit Qt framework initialization in C++ code can be performed in the next way:
```cpp
int
VirgilIoTKitQtInit() {
    QQmlApplicationEngine engine;

    auto features = VSQFeatures() << VSQFeatures::SNAP_INFO_CLIENT << VSQFeatures::SNAP_SNIFFER;    // Use INFO Client and Sniffer features
    auto impl = VSQImplementations() << QSharedPointer<VSQUdpBroadcast>::create();                  // Use UDP Broadcast
    auto roles = VSQDeviceRoles() << VirgilIoTKit::VS_SNAP_DEV_CONTROL;                             // Device has CONTROL role
    auto appConfig = VSQAppConfig() << VSQManufactureId() << VSQDeviceType() << VSQDeviceSerial()
                                    << VirgilIoTKit::VS_LOGLEV_DEBUG << roles << VSQSnapSnifferQmlConfig(); // Device is configured with default options, logger level is DEBUG

    if (!VSQIoTKitFacade::instance().init(features, impl, appConfig)) {                             // Try to initialize Virgil IoTKit Qt Framework
        VS_LOG_CRITICAL("Unable to initialize Virgil IoT KIT");
        return -1;
    }

    QQmlContext *context = engine.rootContext();
    context->setContextProperty("SnapInfoClient", &VSQSnapInfoClientQml::instance());               // Register INFO Client and "SnapInfoClient" data model for QML's ListView
    context->setContextProperty("SnapSniffer", VSQIoTKitFacade::instance().snapSniffer());          // Register SNAP Sniffer and "SnapSniffer" data model for QML's ListView

    const QUrl url(QStringLiteral("qrc:/qml/Main.qml"));                                            // Use qml/main.qml for main QML object
    engine.load(url);

    return QGuiApplication::instance()->exec();                                                     // Start QML application
}
```

In this example you connect necessary modules and launch the QML application. This code is a part of open Virgil IoTKit Qt framework use-case: [Demo IoTKit Qt](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/demo-iotkit-qt/).
