 * \brief base64 functions
 *
 * This header contains base64 encoders/decoders.
 *
 * You can see an example :
 *
 * \code
 * const char *origin = "Test vector";
 * char *encoded = NULL;
 * unsigned char *decoded = NULL;
 * int size_origin = 0;
 * int size_encoded = 0;
 * int size_decoded = 0;
 * bool res = false;
 *
 * // Encoding length
 * size_origin = strlen(origin);
 * size_encoded = base64encode_len(size_origin);
 * assert(size_encoded > 0);
 *
 * // Prepare encoding buffer
 * encoded = malloc(size_encoded);
 * assert(encoded);
 *
 * // Encode
 * res = base64encode((const unsigned char *)origin, size_origin, encoded, &size_encoded);
 * assert(res && size_encoded);
 *
 * // Decoded length
 * size_decoded = base64decode_len(encoded, size_encoded);
 * assert(size_decoded > 0);
 *
 * // Prepare decoding buffer
 * decoded = malloc(size_decoded);
 * assert(decoded);
 *
 * // Decode
 * res = base64decode(encoded, size_encoded, decoded, &size_decoded);
 * assert(res && size_decoded);
 *
 * // Compare results
 * assert(size_decoded == size_origin && !memcmp(origin, decoded, size_origin));
 *
 * // Free buffers
 * free(decoded);
 * free(encoded);
