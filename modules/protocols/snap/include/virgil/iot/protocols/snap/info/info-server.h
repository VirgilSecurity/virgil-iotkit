/*! \file info-server.h
 * \brief INFO for server
 *
 * INFO service is used to provide information about current device state in the local network. Network
 * in this case is limited by SNAP transport protocol.
 *
 * In INFO meaning "Server" is any functional device. "Client" is the special device for statistic collection only.
 * It can be any server PC or MCU device. Servers send their statistic information by startup. Also client can request
 * periodical state sending by polling request.
 *
 * \section info_server_usage INFO Server usage
 *
 * Before first INFO calls usage it is necessary to register INFO Server service :
 *
 * \code
 *
 *    vs_storage_op_ctx_t tl_storage_impl;        // Trust List storage implementation
 *    vs_storage_op_ctx_t fw_storage_impl;        // Firmware storage implementation
 *    vs_snap_service_t *snap_info_server;        // INFO Server SNAP service
 *
 *     // Initialize tl_storage_impl, fw_storage_impl
 *
 *     // Register INFO Server service
 *    snap_info_server = vs_snap_info_server(&tl_storage_impl, &fw_storage_impl, NULL);
 *    STATUS_CHECK(vs_snap_register_service(snap_info_server), "Cannot register INFO Server service");
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * \a tl_storage_impl and \a fw_storage_impl are storage implementations. See \ref storage_hal for details.
 *
