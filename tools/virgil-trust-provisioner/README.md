## Trust Provisioner Overview
Virgil Trust Provisioner deals with key pair and TrustList generation and management, which together make each IoT device identifiable, verifiable and trusted by each party within the IoT solution.

In this connected world, IoT devices interact with many services and applications in order to provide valuable features for end-users. At the same time, it's important that each IoT device is protected from unauthorized access at any given lifecycle stage. In order to achieve this, each party and process within the IoT system needs to be identifiable, verifiable and trusted.

The diagram below demonstrates a standard IoT infrastructure and all its participants, or parties, that need to be identifiable and verifiable as a part of distributed trust system.

Virgil Trust Provisioner helps you to build up a trusted IoT solution ecosystem by creating and managing the key pairs and a distributed TrustList for all participants. Then the keys and TrustList are distributed to all participants (e.g. IoT devices, user application, etc.). As a result, each participant uses the TrustList while interacting with each other to verify whether the participant is authorized to perform a given operation.

### Auth Key
The Auth Key is trusted as the second signer of the firmware and TrustLists.

| Command | Result                                                                                                                |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```3```      | Virgil Trust Provisioner generates 2 Auth Keys  |

#### Generating Auth Key
After Auth Keys are generated they have to be signed with one of the Recovery keys. You also can add a comment about the Key purpose. Auth Key guards against the unauthorized use of firmware and TrustList. Auth Keys sign firmwares and the TrustLists. Public key is stored in the TrustList and the private key is stored in db.

## TrustList Commands
Distributed list of trust that is used by IoT devices and applications to check Information about trusted parties.

### TrustList Overview
TrustList is a distributed list of trust that introduced in way of a file that consists of public keys and signatures of all trusted parties in the your IoT system.

TrustList has basic content structure that was created based on general best security practices, but the final number of trusted participants in the TrustList is determined by you.

After the TrustList is created and signed, it's distributed to all participants (e.g. IoT devices, User Application, etc),  as a result each participant uses the TrustList while interacting with each other to verify wether the participant is authorized to do some operation.

### TrustList Content
Each TrustList contains the following information:

| Information type | Value                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Public Keys      | - Cloud Public Key(s) - Factory Public Key(s)        |
| Signatures       | - Signature of TrustList Key - Signature of Auth Key |

### TrustList structure
TrustList has the following structure:

```bash
type TrustListContainer struct {
    Header           Header
    PubKeysStructure []PubKeyStructure
    Footer           Footer
}

type Header struct {
    WholeTLSize      uint32
    Version          FileVersion
    PubKeysCount     uint16
    SignaturesCount  uint8
}

type PubKeyStructure struct {
    StartDate           uint32
    ExpirationDate      uint32
    KeyType             uint8
    ECType              uint8
    MetadataSize        uint16
    MetadataAndPubKey   [MetadataSize+PublicKeySize]byte
}

type Footer struct {
    TLType        uint8
    Signatures    [SignaturesCount]Signature
}

type Signature struct {
    SignerType               uint8
    ECType                   uint8
    Hash_type                uint8
    SignAndSignerPublicKey   [SignSize+PublicKeySize]byte
}

type FileVersion struct {
    Major           uint8
    Minor           uint8
    Patch           uint8
    Build           uint32
    Timestamp       uint32
}
```

### TrustList Management
Distributed list of trust which contains keys information and is used by IoT devices and applications to check trust information about IoT parties.

| Code | Result                                             |
|------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ```8```   | Virgil Trust Provisioner generates TrustList file  |

### TrustList Generation
TrustList that contains public keys (factory and Cloud) and signatures (Auth Key and TL Key) of all critical system elements.  All public keys in TrustList are stored in TrustListPubKeys.db.

**Example**
```bash
# Launch virgil-trust-provisioner
$ virgil-trust-provisioner --app-token <token> --factory-info <FACTORY_INFO>

# Specify the cli command

$ Please enter option number: 8
$ Are you sure you want to choose [Generate TrustList] [y/n]: y

	2. db: TLServicePrivateKeys, type: tl_service, comment: My TL key, key_id: 64076
$ Please enter option number: 1
# Generation finished
# Storing to file...
# File stored
# TrustList generated and stored in the file storage cpecified in a config file
```

### TrustList Uploading
TrustList updating is a release of the new TrustList. This function is used in case you need to change information about any key, re-generate key or add any new key. You need to create and release the new TrustList and distribute it to your IoT devices. In this case you need to use command ```10``` and distribute the new TrustList to your IoT device.

### TrustList Distribution
This section describes how to distribute a TrustList to IoT devices.

Once you generated your TrustList, you are able to distribute it to all your IoT devices via the Virgil Cloud. IoT devices will get notification as soon as they get online. In order to upload TrustList to the Virgil Cloud you have to run the `publish-trustlist.sh` script from the [scripts folder](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-iotkit/tree/master/scripts) of Virgil IoTKit.

Here is how it works:
- First of all you have to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) library.
- Then navigate to your terminal (cli) and run the `publish-trustlist.sh` from scripts folder.

```bash
$ ./scripts/publish-firmware.sh --tl-file  [path to TrustList file] --app-token [Virgil AppToken]
```

- Once the TrustList uploaded to Virgil Cloud, an IoT gateway gets notification about new TrustList.
- Then IoT gateway gets new TrustList, verifies its signatures (signatures of Firmware and Auth Keys) and installs it.
- At the same time, IoT gateway distributes TrustList to all IoT devices.
- Every IoT device also verifies TrustList signatures and installs it.
