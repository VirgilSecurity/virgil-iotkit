## Features
Virgil IoTKit provides a set of features for IoT device security and management:
- **Crypto Module. Connect any crypto library and Security Module**. Virgil IoTKit provides a flexible and simple API for any types of crypto library and SECMODULE. The framework also provides default Software Security Module implementation based on the Virgil Crypto Library. (Support for ATECC608A and ATECC508A in the next version).
- **Provision Module. Secure IoT device provision**. In order to securely update firmware and securely register, authenticate or exchange messages between IoT devices, each IoT device must have its own tools that allow the device to perform cryptographic operations. These tools must contain information needed to identify the device or other participants (e.g. the TrustList provider). These tools are the device keys, TrustLists, device card, etc. The process of providing your IoT devices with these tools is called device provisioning, and Virgil IoTKit gives you all the functionality needed to make your IoT devices identifiable and verifiable, as a result, protected from counterfeiting and fabrication.
- **Firmware Module. Secure firmware and TrustList verification and distribution**. IoTKit provides a set of APIs for secure verification of firmware in a bootloader. Also, IoTKit provides an example of bootloader implementation in the form of emulator.
- **Secbox Module. Secure storage software for any sensitive data**. IoTKit provides secure storage software that is called **Secbox** for storing any sensitive data, like private keys. The Secbox works in two modes; the first mode - when data is only signed, and the second one - when data is encrypted and then signed.
- **Protocols Module**. IoTKit provides a flexible, programmable security network adaptive protocol (SNAP) for device-to-device, device-to-cloud, and cloud-to-device communication. SNAP can be used for secure firmware distribution, secure notification about device state, and secure device provision. Also, SNAP contains a set of functions and interfaces that allows you to work with any transport protocol (BLE, Wi-Fi, PLC, NoiseSocket, etc.).  
- **Cloud Module. API for working with the Virgil IoT Security Platform**. IoTKit interacts with the Virgil IoT Security Platform to provide you with the services for the security, management, and monitoring of IoT devices.
- **Logger Module**. IoTKit contains a set of functions and interfaces for logging device events.
- **C/C++ support**. Library is implemented on C99. There is C++ integration based on Qt crossplatform library. Also there are tools implemented on Golang.

<div id='iot-dev-tools'/>

## IoT Dev Tools
Virgil Security also provides a set of tools for secure device lifecycle:
- **Virgil Trust Provisioner**. The Virgil Trust Provisioner is a CLI used to manage your distributed trust between all parties, including IoT devices, in your IoT solutions. The CLI is aimed at key pairs and TrustList generation and management, which together make each IoT device identifiable, verifiable and trusted by each party of IoT solution. To start working with the tool, read more [here](/tools/virgil-trust-provisioner).
- **Virgil Device Initializer**. In order to make each IoT device identifiable, verifiable and trusted by each party of IoT solution, you have to provide it with specific provision files, generate private keys and create the digital cards for further device registration on the Virgil Cloud. Virgil Device Initializer allows you to make IoT device provisioning and prepare your IoT device (create digital cards) for its further registration on the Virgil Cloud. To start working with the tool, read more [here](/tools/virgil-device-initializer).
- **Virgil Device Registrar**. Virgil IoT Device Registrar is used to register IoT devices and their digital cards with the Virgil Security Cloud. To start working with the tool, read more [here](/tools/virgil-device-registrar).
- **Virgil Firmware Signer**. Virgil Firmware Signer is a CLI that allows you to sign firmware in order to provide integrity before distributing it. To start working with the tool, read more [here](/tools/virgil-firmware-signer).
- **Virgil SnapD**. Virgil SnapD is a local web utility which allows you to obtain information and statistics about your IoT devices. In order to get such device information, SnapD interacts with Virgil SNAP protocol, which operates directly with your IoT devices. As far as Virgil SnapD is a local service, the obtained information can be displayed in browser under http://localhost:8080/ (by default). If you're working with the Virgil IoT Simulator, you can run SnapD under http://localhost:8081/. To start working with the tool, read more [here](/tools/virgil-snapd).

<div id='run-iotkit-sandbox'/>

## Run IoTKit Sandbox
To demonstrate our IoTKit in action we developed [Sandbox based on IoTKit](/scripts).

The Sandbox is conditionally divided into 3 actors (Vendor, Factory and End-user) and shows the secure lifecycle of IoT devices. The Sandbox allows you to:
- **Generate trusted provisioning package**. To start working with emulated IoT infrastructure, the Sandbox uses Virgil Trust Provisioner utility for generating provisioning files, such as private keys (e.g. for factory, firmware) and a distributed TrustList that contains public keys and signatures of trusted service providers (e.g. factory, cloud).
- **Emulate IoT devices**. Then, you can emulate two IoT device types: IoT Gateway - an internet-capable smart device that communicates with other IoT devices and the Virgil Cloud; and IoT Device - edge device, like smart bulb, that can be controlled remotely through the IoT Gateway.
- **Securely perform IoT device provisioning**. Sandbox uses the Virgil Device Initializer for IoT devices provisioning to make them identifiable, verifiable and trusted. Securely integrate TrusList into IoT device, then generate key pair and create digital card, and sign digital card with the device key.
- **Register IoT devices on the security platform**. On this step, the Virgil Device Registrar is used to register digital cards of IoT devices with the Virgil Cloud for further device authentication and management.
- **Sign and publish new Firmware and TrustList**. Also, you can emulate the process of creating and publishing new Firmware or TrustList to Virgil Cloud. Sandbox uses Virgil Firmware Signer to sign a firmware before its distributing.
- **Manage IoT devices**. Sandbox allows you to manage IoT devices and get information about their state. Sandbox uses Virgil services to notify IoT devices about new updates and then securely verify incoming firmware or TrustLists before updating them.

<div id='iotkit-usage'/>

## IoTKit Usage
To start working with Virgil IoTKit you have to:
- specify configuration parameters.
- provide implementations (you can also use default implementations).

### Configuration parameters

#### Configuration headers directory
There are configuration headers that customize Virgil IoTKit, they are stored in **config directory**. You can provide your headers or use standard ones.
It's necessary to add `VIRGIL_IOT_CONFIG_DIRECTORY` variable that points to the directory with configuration files.

> For example, if you want to use PC configuration provided by library and library is stored in `virgil-iotkit` directory, you have to set compiler option: `-DVIRGIL_IOT_CONFIG_DIRECTORY virgil-iotkit/config/pc`.

#### MCU Build
The `VIRGIL_IOT_MCU_BUILD` variable enables or disables microcontroller features. If some microcontroller features are not compatible with your PC configuration or you don't need to use MCU features, you can disable them through the  `VIRGIL_IOT_MCU_BUILD` variable during compilation: `-DVIRGIL_IOT_MCU_BUILD=OFF`.

#### Mobile platforms Build
To include Virgil IoTKit Qt framewrok use integration/qt/iotkit.pri for Qt Creator.

### Mandatory implementations
Some IoTKit modules use external implementations, therefore it's necessary to implement HAL (hardware abstraction layer) functions:
- [Storage context](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/storage__hal_8h.html): structure **vs_storage_op_ctx_t**
contains external data operations like open/read/write/close. See [Storage HAL](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/storage__hal_8h.html) for details.
- [Firmware](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/firmware_8h.html): **vs_firmware_install_prepare_space_hal**,
**vs_firmware_install_append_data_hal** and **vs_firmware_get_own_firmware_footer_hal** functions have to be implemented for firmware processing. See [Firmware HAL](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/firmware__hal_8h.html#details) for details.
- [Logger](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/logger_8h.html): depends on [logger-config.h](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/logger-config_8h.html) configurations **vs_logger_output_hal** for string output and/or **vs_logger_current_time_hal** for current time output. See [Logger HAL](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/logger-hal_8h.html) for details.
- [SNAP protocol](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/snap_8h.html): **vs_netif_t** network interface as
transport level for SNAP protocol. As [UDP broadcast example](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/demo-iotkit-nix/blob/release/v0.1.0-alpha/common/src/sdk-impl/netif/netif-udp-broadcast.c) user can use c-implementation tool.
See [SNAP Reference](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/snap-structs_8h.html) for details.
- [FLDT Server](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/fldt-server_8h.html) is a service that is used by a IoT Gateway for files (e.g. firmware, TrustLists) distribution for IoT devices. Server sends new files in the network to IoT Devices and processes Client requests for new files.
- [FLDT Client](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/fldt-client_8h.html) is client for FLDT service that used by IoT Devices to receive new files (e.g. Firmware, TrustLists) from IoT Gateway. FLDT Client also can request files versions.
- [PRVS Client](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/prvs-client_8h.html): there is a need to implement **vs_snap_prvs_client_impl_t** structure. This structure contains wait functions for SNAP interface. You can see example of implementation in the [c-implementation](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-iotkit/blob/release/v0.1.0-alpha/tools/c-implementation/src/helpers/ti_wait_functionality.c).

### Default Mandatory implementations
Virgil IoTKit also provides default mandatory implementations:
- [Cloud](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/cloud_8h.html) : **vs_cloud_impl_t** and **vs_cloud_message_bin_impl_t** are required `by vs_cloud_init`. Function `vs_curl_http_impl` returns cURL HTTP implementation, `vs_cloud_message_bin_impl_t` returns MQTT implementation.
- [Crypto](https://virgilsecurity.github.io/virgil-iotkit/secmodule_8h.html) introduces security module implementation structure **vs_secmodule_impl_t**. Function `vs_soft_secmodule_impl` returns software implementation.
